# GitHub Explorer App

This is a sample App from the [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) course. Nice approach to learn ReactJS using the GitHub API.

## Start

* `yarn` -> Setup project's configuration.
* `yarn start` -> Start the server on http://localhost:3000/

## Use

Now you can add a user/repository (type `rcmoutinho/public-speaking`, for example) and check some details from the project.

All the data is store on the browser's local storage.
